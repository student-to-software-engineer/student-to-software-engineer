# 1.3. You Need To Learn To Build Software

If you want to become a software engineer, a key part of your job is choosing the right tools for the task.

To do that, you first need to know what tools are out there — different languages, libraries, datastores, cloud services, and more.

It sounds simple, but due to a lack of guidance, many students lack this key understanding.

Think of it this way:

- In order to be a car mechanic, you need to learn how different parts of a car work and fit together.
- In order to become a doctor, you need to know the parts of the human body works and how to diagnose illnesses.
- In order to become a chef, you need to learn how different ingredients pair together and how to use various cooking techniques.

A computer scientist who doesn't know the components of a software is like:

- a mechanic who doesn't know what an engine is
- a doctor who doesn't know the parts of the human
- a chef who doesn't know what ingredients exist

Why would you want to hire a **software engineer who doesn't know how to build software?**

Your degree focuses on the fundamentals of computer science, it will likely **NOT** focus on teaching you industry standards for utilizing the different components of software systems or how to build real-world applications.

In this handbook, we will cover the key components of software systems, how they fit together, and how to present your skills in a way that resonates with employers.

[Chapter 5](../5-technical-skill-roadmap/index.md) will cover what parts make up apps and how you get get started learning each of them.

[Chapter 6](../6-gaining-experience-without-formal-employment/index.md) will cover the best ways to gain real experience building software without a job.

[Chapter 7](../7-find-your-first-internship/index.md) will cover how to find your first internship and how to present your skills effectively.
