## What is this?

**Student To Software Engineer** is a free, open guide to launching your career in tech—written for students and new grads who don’t know where to start or are struggling to stand out.

If you're overwhelmed by bad advice, feeling stuck, or just want a clear roadmap, this guide is for you. It’s shaped by real-world experience navigating internships, landing full-time roles, and mentoring hundreds of students through that journey.

Inside, you’ll find practical strategies for:

- Getting your first job or internship (even with no experience)
- Making the most of your time in university
- Learning what actually matters to employers
- Building projects that *prove* you know your stuff
- Navigating a changing job market shaped by AI, layoffs, and oversaturation
